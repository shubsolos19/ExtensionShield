Scoring Engine Module

THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for extension risk scoring.

This module provides the main ScoringEngine class that orchestrates:
1. Signal normalization to severity [0,1] + confidence [0,1]
2. Layer score calculation (Security, Privacy, Governance)
3. Hard gate evaluation (can override scores)
4. Complete result generation with explanations

Mathematical Foundation:
    Layer Risk: R = Σ(w_i × c_i × s_i) / Σ(w_i × c_i)
    Layer Score: score = round(100 × (1 - R))
    Overall Score: weighted average of layer scores

Where:
    w_i = weight of factor i
    c_i = confidence in factor i [0,1]
    s_i = severity of factor i [0,1]
